Development of the Chinese Archery app for ChinesePod

This is a partially-developed prototype of an app for ChinesePod.

Development environment:
macOS High Sierra 10.13.6;
Xcode 10.0;
Simulator iPhone XR - 12.0 (Portrait).

Important: because of the limited time I have had to work on these apps, there has not been
time to implement handling for different screen sizes and orientations. It is therefore strongly
recommended that this app is tested with the iPhone XR Simulator in Portrait orientation, as
this was the Simulator used for develepment and testing.

The prototype apps are not complete. I had very little time to develop these prototypes, 
I had two different prototypes to develop, and I was learning how to develop apps from scratch 
as part of this process.

They are intended to give some idea of what the final apps should do, but further work will be required 
to turn these apps into professional products, including adding further functionality, improving the user 
interface and graphical design. The current graphical design is very basic and should not be taken as an 
indication of the graphical design of the final product.

Archery - Game Concept

The basic concept of the game is that a word definition appears below an archery target and a number
of Chinese characters appear near the centre of the target. The characters then move towards the edge of the
target. The player needs to tap on the character(s) matching the definition. If they tap the correct character(s)
then points are scored - the closer to the centre of the target the character(s) are tapped the more points are
scored. If the player taps the wrong character(s) or the character(s) reach the edge of the target then no points are
scored and a life is lost. Lives are represented by arrows.

The vocabulary can be selected from HSK levels and/or ChinesePod levels. The app is linked to the player's
ChinesePod account and the player can choose all vocabularly from all ChinesePod lessons in chosen levels or
can choose only to include words from the lessons they have marked as studied.

Archery - Further Developments

1) The prototype only implements basic graphics, so there is work to be done on the graphic design. 

2) There is currently no sound in the game, so sound effects, music, and optional pronounciation of the 
Chinese words could all be added.

3) It is intended that the user should be able to choose how many words to be displayed on the target. 
For example the choice of 2, 4, or 6 options would lead to increasing difficulty, with the words shown
in different segments of the target. This has not yet been fully implemented, so only 4 segments are currently
available.

4) The vocabularly lists need to be added along with the link to ChinesePod vocabularly. Currently only a few words
are in the app's dictionary for testing purposes.

5) The settings view is currently basic and the controls aren't connected to the code.
